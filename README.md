# Bayesien_Network_A.I
Bayesien Network A.I Project, where I had to implement sampling algorithms : 
Here are the methods implemented : inferenceApproche which represents the rejection sampling inference algorithm, the method inferenceGibbs that represents the Gibbs sampling algorithm, the method inferenceExacte that represents the exact inference Algorithm.
